# BusManager

Hello!

This is a program that reads a supplied input file and populates a set of Bus objects. Once the input process is
complete, the program reads user transactions from the console to query the busses in several ways. 

This Program has different iterations throughout the stages that I have been working on it. It is focused on OOP concepts, in particular using static arrays of objects, class aggregation, operator overloading, static members,class managers, abstraction, and dynamic allocation.
